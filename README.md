## Double Cryptography

Hello, welcome to my browser based game Double Cryptography!
This was built using Ruby on Rails backend and a ReactJS frontend by Zoe Xanos

### Work in Progress

There are still a few functional elements that need to be added. I'm currently working on being able to create a new user, save the user to the backend, and also save and store data on how many case files a user has solved.
In the meantime, the login button will carry you to the main page under a default user. That way, anyone can still explore the game while I build out the rest of these components

### How The Game Works

When you pass through Login and head to the landing screen, talk to the NPC Graham. He will give you background information on why you are here and the goals of the game.

### Tutorial

I would suggest going to the sidebar and playing the tutorial first. The frontend and backend are hosted through Heroku, sometimes a takes a moment for the tutorial images to load. Once loaded, you can talk to Grahama and he will lead you through solving the tutorial problem.

### Case Files

Currently there are three case files available. Each case file has a phrase that needs to be decoded. The third file is especially difficult, I hope you enjoy the challenge!

## Inspiration

This project is a hodge podge of different things I've loved since I was a little kid. I always wanted to be a detective and I grew up with a lot of black and white films and video games. This was my final project for Flatiron and I wanted to do something that meant a lot to me.
I was surprised to see the positive reaction from friends and family when I unveiled Double Cryptography during the project showcase. 
I want to keep working on it and experiment with new CSS styles and tools to make this feel like a full fledged game.

### Thank you!
